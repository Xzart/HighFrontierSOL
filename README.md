Mobile HTML5 + CSS + JQuery application for High Frontier 3ed board game.

High Frontier (3rd edition) is a space exploration game by Phil Eklund. The players take control of different space enterprises trying to establish factories on planets and asteroids. Each player begins with three water tanks (fuel). In turns each player uses two action points to do some of the eight actions available, e.g. move space ship or buy new technologies. When the predetermined number of bases is built the game ends. The winner is the player with the most victory points.
